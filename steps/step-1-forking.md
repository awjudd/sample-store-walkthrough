Step 1 - Forking
==========

In essence, the idea of a fork is making a branch/copy of someone else's repository in order to make/suggest changes.  With a fork, you receive full access to the local version of the repository (normally forked into your local environment).  Normally with a fork, you intend to submit a **pull request** (we will get to these later) to get your updates back into the actual source code, or use it as a starting point for any of your projects going forward.

So, you may be wondering, how do you fork a repository?  Well, that is simple.  With GitHub, all you need to do is look at the top right corner of the screen and there should be a "Fork" button.

### Exercise

Forking the Sample Store repository.  On GitHub, navigate to [https://github.com/awjudd/sample-store](the repository).  From there, there should be a button at the **top right** corner that says "Fork".

Once you click this button, you will be asked where you want to fork it into.  Select your personal account.
