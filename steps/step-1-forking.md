Step 1 - Forking
==========

## What is forking?

In essence, the idea of a fork is making a branch/copy of someone else's repository in order to make/suggest changes.  With a fork, you receive full access to the local version of the repository (normally forked into your local environment).  Normally with a fork, you intend to submit a **pull request** (we will get to these later) to get your updates back into the actual source code, or use it as a starting point for any of your projects going forward.

So, you may be wondering, how do you fork a repository?  Well, that is simple.  With GitHub, all you need to do is look at the top right corner of the screen and there should be a "Fork" button.

## Exercise

Forking the Sample Store repository.  On GitHub, navigate to [the repository](https://github.com/git-walkthrough/sample-store).  From there, there should be a button at the **top right** corner that says "Fork".

Once you click this button, you will be asked where you want to fork it into.  Select your personal account.

After initiating the fork, you should be redirected to a repository which looks identical to the one you were just on.  However, it will say at the very top of the page "forked from".  This tells you two things:
1. That this repository is a copy of the other work.
2. There are possible intentions to merge back into the main project at one point in time.

Once forked, the code is your own.  You can do whatever you want with it without worrying affecting anyone else.

## Next Steps

Now that we have our own version of the repository, it is time to [clone it](step-2-cloning.md).
