Step 7 - Branching
==============

## Overview

Branches are normally used for one of the following:

 - Developing new features
 - Fix bugs
 - Safely experiment with new ideas / refactoring of code

Branches in git are the exact same and they even allow for a bit more functionality since the entire repository is stored locally.  So, you are actually able to have both a local branch or a remote branch.  With git, you are also able to lock down permissions to certain branches to only allow certain people to commit to certain places for added security.

## Exercise

Making a branch 2 ways!

### Through GitHub

On the GitHub version of your repository, click on the drop down list that says "Branch: master".  Once you click on it, you will see an input box.  This box will actually filter through any branches that you currently have in the repository, **or** let you make a new branch.  Let's start by making a new branch.  Type in "remote-branch" and hit the "Create branch" link.

This will automatically make the branch for you to access and change.
