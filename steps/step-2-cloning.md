Step 2 - Cloning
============

## Overview

Cloning is your way of getting a copy of the repository on your local computer.  Some keywords that we just said here are "of the repository".  A Git repository is 100% self-contained.  This means that there is no absolute need to clone nor to even host it elsewhere.  However, if you do, in order to make changes from your local computer you need to **clone** it.

This will download all of the files, including all of the commits (aka change sets) to your local computer.   Once downloaded, you will be able to make any of the necessary changes to it.

GitHub allows for two different authentication methods when cloning repositories.  They both use different secure transfer methods:

 - https
 - ssh

## Exercise

Open up your favourite git client (or command line interface) and clone your copy of the repository.

Command Line:

```
git clone https://github.com/{your username}/sample-store
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the repository available locally, open up the folder where you downloaded it to and move onto [modifying it](step-3-commiting.md).
